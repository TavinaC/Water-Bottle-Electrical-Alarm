-------
This is a minimum viable product (MVP) prototype for the Water Bottle Electrical Alarm (W.B.E.A.). Its premise is to help its
users stay hydrated without extra hassle. It has a custom alarm feature and a water detector that will automatically reset the 
alarm whenever its user takes a sip of water for a hassle-free experience. It is engineered to fit on almost any generic metal 
water bottle such as a Hydroflask. The drinking spout is also designed to block the water detector so it won't accidentally reset itself.
The MVP utilizes an Arduino Uno as its microcontroller and two mini-breadboards so its size is quite substantial but works as a
proof of concept. 

Use the website https://cloud.arduino.cc to inject the code into an arduino to run.
